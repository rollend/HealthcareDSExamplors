 2. Stranded Patient/Length of Stay (LOS)/Delay transfer of care (DTOC) [No data and code included]<br/>
  -Briefing: Predict whether the patient will be stranded (>7 days), forecasting his/her LOS, predict whether the patient will be delayed or not; These three projects are all derived from similar patient data, the important requirement is predict/forcast as early as possible. We have explored using SNOMED, ICD10 code as well as blood test results. Finally we are using accute data, and first three days of admission with blood test results to make early prediction. <br/>
  -Below diagram shows the exploration of ICD10 code classifies different patients <br/>
